Ensure you have followed all the steps for installing and linking the native module.  If you installed it manually, double-check that all the necessary native code is included and correctly linked in both Android and iOS. If using a package that supports autolinking (most modern packages do) ensure you've cleaned and rebuilt the project after the installation. If the problem persists and the issue is not with your project setup but the module itself, consider reporting the issue to the module's developers. Below is an example of a common problem:

```javascript
// Incorrect import (common cause of the error)
import {MyNativeModule} from 'react-native-my-module'; 

// Correct import (If MyNativeModule is defined correctly)
import MyNativeModule from 'react-native-my-module';
```
